# claude-smart (`csm`)

Cross-platform smart session manager for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

`csm` is a single binary that wraps the `claude` CLI with:

- **smart session selection** — resume the right session, or start fresh, per
  directory;
- **profile management** — multiple isolated Claude Code config homes
  (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) with a one-command switcher;
- **account scoring + auto-switch** — pick the least-saturated account to launch
  under, and relaunch on a rate-limit hit;
- **usage metering** — a multi-profile usage table (opt-in; see *Hub*);
- a **limit-detection hook** and a **relaunch/handoff loop**.

It runs on macOS, Linux/WSL, and Windows-native with a single binary — no shell
implementation to keep in sync.

## Install

```sh
# from crates.io
cargo install claude-smart

# or build from source
git clone https://github.com/DaveDev42/claude-smart
cd claude-smart && cargo install --path .
```

The binary is named `csm`. An optional shell function lets `cas` switch the
active profile in your *current* shell (a child process cannot mutate its
parent's environment, so this part is a tiny shim — see *Profiles* below).

## Usage

```
csm [claude-args...]                 bare = smart launch (implicit `csm run`)
csm run [csm-flags] [-- claude...]   smart launcher (session + account + relaunch)

csm profiles [list]                  list configured profiles
csm profiles add  <name> [<dir>]     register (dir defaults to ~/.claude.<name>)
csm profiles set  <name> <dir>       register/overwrite a profile dir
csm profiles rm   <name>             unregister (refused if it is the default)
csm profiles use  <name>             set the machine default profile
csm profiles edit                    interactive editor (TTY)
csm profiles dir  [<name>]           print a profile's config dir

csm usage [--json] [--no-fetch]      multi-profile usage table (opt-in; see Hub)

csm pick-account [<cur>] [--include-current]
csm scan [<cwd>]                     session listing (TSV)
csm statusline                       `<profile>@<host>` for the shell prompt
csm completions {zsh|bash|pwsh}      shell completions
```

### No collision with `claude`

`csm` only treats a known word as its own subcommand. **Any word it doesn't
recognize is forwarded verbatim to `claude`** — so `csm mcp`, `csm doctor`,
`csm update`, `csm /login`, etc. all reach the real `claude` untouched. The
reserved word set is deliberately disjoint from claude's subcommands. To pass a
flag that `csm` would otherwise interpret (`-c`, `-r`, `-n`, `--model`, …),
put it after `--`: `csm run -- -c`.

## Profiles

A *profile* is a named Claude Code config home (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`). The
registry is a flat JSON map at `~/.config/claude-as/profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "personal": "/home/you/.claude.personal",
  "work":     "/home/you/.claude.work"
}
```

The machine default profile NAME lives in `~/.config/claude-as/default`. Manage
the registry with `csm profiles …` (or the interactive `csm profiles edit`). No
account names are compiled into the binary — everything comes from your
registry.

### Switching the active profile in your shell

Add a tiny function so `cas <name>` switches `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the *current*
shell (the binary prints an `export` line; the shell evals it):

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
cas() { eval "$(command csm cas --eval --shell zsh -- "$@")"; }
```

```powershell
# $PROFILE
function cas { Invoke-Expression ((Get-Command csm -CommandType Application).Source + " cas --eval --shell pwsh -- " + ($args -join ' ')) }
```

`cas <name>` switches this shell; `cas -g <name>` / `csm profiles use <name>`
sets the machine-wide default; `cas status` shows the current/default/available
profiles.

## Hub (usage metering — opt-in)

`csm usage` and account scoring read usage data from a **hub** — a machine you
designate that periodically scrapes Claude Code usage limits and serves them.
This is entirely opt-in via two environment variables; **with neither set, the
hub features are simply disabled** and `csm` works as a plain smart launcher:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_USAGE_URL` | HTTP endpoint that returns the usage JSON blob. Empty/unset = HTTP disabled. |
| `CLAUDE_HUB_HOSTNAME` | Short hostname of the hub. When it matches the local host, `csm` reads the hub's cache directly (no network). |

When unset, `csm usage` prints a "metering disabled" line and still shows your
registry. When the hub is unreachable, `csm usage` serves the last-known cache
with a staleness header (`⚠ hub data is 7m old …`); `--no-fetch` reads only the
cache. No hub identifiers are baked into the binary — it ships clean for anyone
to use.

(The usage JSON shape, the collector, and a reference hub deployment are
documented in the design notes under `docs/`.)
